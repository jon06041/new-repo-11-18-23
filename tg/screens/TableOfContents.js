1. Clindamycin ovules use an oleaginous base that might weaken latex or rubber products (e.g., condoms and diaphragms). Use of such products within 72 hours following treatment with clindamycin ovules is not recommended.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
2. Oral granules should be sprinkled onto unsweetened applesauce, yogurt, or pudding before ingestion. A glass of water can be taken after administration to aid in swallowing.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
3. Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonorrhea section).
{'\n'}{'\n'}
4. Data are limited regarding the effectiveness and optimal dose of azithromycin for treating chlamydial infection among infants and children who weigh less than 45 kg.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
5. An association between oral erythromycin and azithromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has been reported among infants aged less than 6 weeks. Infants treated with either of these antimicrobials should be followed for IHPS signs and symptoms.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
6. For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 gm ceftriaxone should be administered.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
7. Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
8. Acyclovir 200 mg orally five times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of the frequency of dosing.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
9. Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other valacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent recurrences (i.e., ≥10 episodes/year).
{'\n'}{'\n'}
10. Acyclovir 400 mg orally three times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of frequency of dosing.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
11. Treatment recommended starting at 36 weeks gestation. (Source: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists. Management of herpes in pregnancy. ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 82. Obstet Gynecol 2007;109:1489–98.)
{'\n'}{'\n'}
12. Persons with external anal or peri-anal warts might also have intra-anal warts. Thus, persons with external anal warts might benefit from an inspection of the anal canal by digital examination, standard anoscopy, or high-resolution anoscopy.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
13. Might weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
14. The use of a cryoprobe in the vagina is not recommended because of the risk for vaginal perforation and fistula formation.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
15. Management of cervical warts should include consultation with a specialist. For women who have exophytic cervical warts, a biopsy evaluation to exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion should be performed before treatment is initiated.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
16. Management of intra-anal warts should include consultation with a specialist.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
17. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally two times/day for 7 days (if pregnant, treat with azithromycin 1 gm orally in a single dose).
{'\n'}{'\n'}
18. Providers should consider one-time lavage of the infected eye with saline solution.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
19. When treating for the arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, the provider can switch to an oral agent guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) 24 to 48 hours after substantial clinical improvement, for a total treatment course of less than 7 days.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
20. Because this regimen has not been validated rigorously, a test-of-cure with Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) 4 weeks after completion of treatment can be considered. 21. Infants and young children (aged less than 5 years) should be treated with permethrin.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
22. Oral ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity; a second dose is required for cure.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
23. Infants and children aged less than 10 years should not be treated with lindane.
{'\n'}{'\n'}
24. The complete list of recommendations on treating syphilis among people with HIV infection and pregnant women, as well as discussion of alternative therapy in people with penicillin allergy, can be found in Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021.

25. For management of persistent or recurrent infection, refer to Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021.
